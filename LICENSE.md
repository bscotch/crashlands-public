License details vary for different kinds of content in this git repository. A given LICENSE file, like this one, applies to all files and folders in the same folder as that LICENSE file, recursively. A LICENSE file deeper in the tree overrides any parent LICENSE file, and then applies recursively. This file is the root LICENSE file, which provides default licensing information.

All licensing described in this repository applies ONLY to the files within this repository.

We reserve all rights to all images, text, and other content that comes directly from our games (collectively, "Game Assets"), or that is derived from Game Assets. You may modify and/or redistribute that content for certain kinds of community activities, such as community wikis and other community documentation/support services, as long as you follow our [Intellectual Property Guidelines](https://www.bscotch.net/intellectual-property). When in doubt, create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/bscotch/crashlands-public/issues) describing what you want to do so we can give you explicit allow/deny permission. Only GitHub user @adam-coster can give licensing permission in this way, and note that licensing of any of our content is always revokable and non-exclusive unless otherwise specified.

Any computer code files in this repository fall under the MIT license unless otherwise specified in the code files themselves, or by another LICENSE file, or by explicit permission granted by GitHub user @adam-coster.
