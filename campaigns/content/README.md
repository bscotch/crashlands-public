# Crashlands Asset Thumbnails and Descriptions

_See the [license](../../LICENSE.md) for what you're allowed to do with this content!_

Campaign files describe how game content relates to other game content, and defines some kinds of assets completely (e.g. NPCs), but does not provide full definitions for all assets. For example, campaign files may refer to the unique IDs of various items that get dropped by a boss fight, or upon completion of a quest, but do not have information about what those items actually _are_.

This folder includes [an index](./index.json) describing most of that content, along with thumbnail images of game assets, which can be used in combination with campaign file data to match unique identifiers to images, names, descriptions, and other details.

The index file includes:

- Numeric identifier (`idx`) values for creatures, items, etc.
- Listing of which images are associated with any given asset.
- Names and descriptions of each asset.
